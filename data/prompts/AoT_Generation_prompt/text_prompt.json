    "system_prompt": "You are a powerful reasoning model. I will present you with a question and the correct answer.\nYour task is to output the intermediate reasoning process to meet the following requirements.\n\n- The reasoning process contains several reasoning steps that can support the correct answer.\n- Each reasoning step should begin with a concise high-level plan, followed by a detailed step-by-step implementation.\n- The high-level plans should be tailored to the specific question. They may encompass, but are not limited to: extracting key information from the question, sub-questions decomposed from the target question, analyzing certain aspects of the question, evaluating different options and possibilities, recalling relevant knowledge and rules, applying knowledge and rules for reasoning, comparing different content, concluding and answering.\n- Each step should aim to draw new conclusions and not merely repeat the question or the content of the previous step.\n- Conclude the reasoning process by stating the final answer as \"The answer is \\boxed{answer}\".\n",

            "user": "Sara's sister has 4 small notebooks in her closet. Last summer she ordered 6 more notebooks and then lost 2. How many notebooks does Sara's sister have now?\n\nCorrect Answer: 8\n",
            "assistant": "Step 1: Identify the initial number of notebooks.\nSara's sister initially has 4 notebooks.\n\nStep 2: Add the number of notebooks ordered.\nShe ordered 6 more notebooks, so the total becomes 4 + 6 = 10 notebooks.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the number of notebooks lost.\nShe lost 2 notebooks, so the final count is 10 - 2 = 8 notebooks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{8}.\n"

            "assistant": "Step 1: Recall the order of adjectives in English.\nThe generally accepted order of adjectives in English is: quantity, quality, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option according to the adjective order rule.\n(A) Indonesian (origin) triangular (shape) obnoxious (quality) gold (material) red (color) shoe (noun)\n(B) obnoxious (quality) triangular (shape) red (color) Indonesian (origin) gold (material) shoe (noun)\n\nStep 3: Compare the options.\nOption (A) has the incorrect order because \"origin\" comes before \"shape\" and \"quality\", and \"material\" comes before \"color\". \nOption (B) follows the correct order: quality, shape, color, origin, material.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{(B)}.\n"

            "user": "For their 70th annual Thanksgiving Day game, the Lions hosted a rematch with division rivals the Green Bay Packers. Detroit got an early lead when Matthew Stafford threw a 1-yard TD pass to Calvin Johnson, the only Lions score of the first half. The Packers responded with a TD of their own, a 7-yard toss to Donald Lee. The Packers then kicked 2 field goals: first a 20 yarder and just before halftime a 25 yarder. The Packers scored 2 touchdowns in the 3rd quarter. First a 7-yard catch by Donald Driver, then a 21-yard catch by James Jones. The Lions picked up a safety when the Packers Ryan Grant had his left arm down before he fumbled the ball in their own end zone in the fourth quarter. They then kicked a 22-yard field goal. The Packers sealed their win when Charles Woodson intercepted a Stafford pass and ran it back 38 yards for a touchdown. The Thanksgiving Day losing streak for the Lions is now six, the longest in franchise history. With the loss combined with the Eagles win over the Redskins, the Lions were officially eliminated from postseason contention. This would also become the Packers' 9th straight victory over the Lions, dating back to the second game between the teams in the 2005 season.\n\nHow many yards was the second longest touchdown?\n\nCorrect Answer: 21\n",
            "assistant": "Step 1: Extract key information about touchdowns from the text.\nThe touchdowns mentioned are:\n- A 1-yard TD pass to Calvin Johnson\n- A 7-yard TD pass to Donald Lee\n- A 7-yard catch by Donald Driver\n- A 21-yard catch by James Jones\n- A 38-yard interception return for a touchdown by Charles Woodson\n\nStep 3: Sort the yardages in descending order.\n38 yards, 21 yards, 7 yards, 7 yards, 1 yard\n\nStep 3: Identify the second longest touchdown.\nThe second longest touchdown is 21 yards.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{21}.\n"
